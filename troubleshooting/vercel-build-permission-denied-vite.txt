ERROR: Vercel Build Permission Denied - Vite Binary
====================================================

Error Message:
--------------
sh: line 1: /vercel/path0/node_modules/.bin/vite: Permission denied
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 126

Root Cause:
-----------
The vite binary in node_modules/.bin/vite doesn't have execute permissions
in the Vercel build environment. This is a common issue when binaries are
installed without proper permissions or when file permissions aren't preserved
during deployment.

Solution:
---------
Use `npx vite build` instead of `vite build` in the package.json build script.
The `npx` command handles execution permissions properly and will work even
if the binary doesn't have execute permissions.

Fixed package.json script:
--------------------------
"build": "npx vite build"

Instead of:
"build": "vite build"

Why This Works:
--------------
- `npx` is a package runner that comes with npm
- It automatically handles permission issues by using Node.js to execute scripts
- It's more reliable in CI/CD environments like Vercel
- It ensures the correct version of vite is used from node_modules

Prevention:
-----------
- Always use `npx` for build commands in package.json when deploying to Vercel
- This applies to other build tools as well (TypeScript, ESLint, etc.)
- Example: "build": "npx vite build" instead of "build": "vite build"

Related Issues:
--------------
- Similar permission issues can occur with other binaries (tsc, eslint, etc.)
- Solution: Use npx for all binary executions in npm scripts
- Example: "type-check": "npx tsc --noEmit"

Date Fixed: 2024
File Modified: package.json
