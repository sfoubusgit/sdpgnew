🟣 CURSOR PROMPT — CREATE EXTREMELY NUANCED INTERVIEW JSON CONTENT

Important context:
The project already contains a Guided Prompt Interview Creator with TypeScript types, a useInterviewEngine hook, and a prompt assembler as described in ABOUT_THE_PROGRAM.txt.
Your task in this prompt is to only create and populate JSON files under src/data/interview/ that define a very large, nuanced decision tree.

1️⃣ High-Level Goal

Populate src/data/interview/ with an extremely nuanced, content-rich set of JSON files that define:

Deep character creation (EXTREME depth, every safe aspect)

Deep art style and rendering style

Deep environment / world / setting

Plus effects and camera options

All JSON must conform to the InterviewNode, RefinementNode, WeightAttribute, and AnswerOption interfaces already defined in src/types/interview.ts (as described in ABOUT_THE_PROGRAM.txt).

You MUST:

Not modify any React/TS code

Only add or update JSON content files

Keep everything safe (no sexual, explicit, or fetish content)

Maximize nuance in a SFW way: style, mood, structure, details, expression, etc.

2️⃣ Scope: EXTREME Nuance in Every Aspect

Treat all parts as EXTREME:

Character: EXTREMELY detailed

Art style: EXTREMELY detailed

Environment: EXTREMELY detailed

Aim for at least ~200 nodes, ideally more (up to ~400–500), spread across many JSON files and subfolders.

You may put multiple nodes in one JSON file (arrays), but keep them logically grouped.

3️⃣ Folder & File Structure

Create/ensure this structure exists:

src/data/interview/
  root.json

  character/
    identity.json
    body.json
    face.json
    hair.json
    clothing.json
    accessories.json
    personality.json
    expression.json
    pose.json
    archetype.json
    ethnicity.json
    fantasy_races.json
    scifi_races.json
    powers.json

  style/
    artstyle_root.json
    anime_styles.json
    realism_styles.json
    painting_styles.json
    3d_styles.json
    cinematic_styles.json
    color_palettes.json
    texture_materials.json

  environment/
    env_root.json
    nature_biomes.json
    cities_and_settlements.json
    interiors.json
    fantasy_realms.json
    scifi_worlds.json
    ruins_and_structures.json
    weather.json
    atmosphere_and_mood.json
    time_of_day.json
    terrain_details.json

  effects/
    magic_and_aura.json
    particles_and_sparks.json
    fog_and_haze.json
    light_effects.json
    distortions_and_glitches.json

  camera/
    lens_and_focal_length.json
    angle_and_perspective.json
    framing_and_composition.json
    depth_of_field.json
    motion_and_blur.json
    render_quality.json


Each of these JSON files will contain one or more InterviewNode objects (as an object or an array).

4️⃣ JSON Schema (Must Match Existing Types)

For every node, follow this schema (which matches src/types/interview.ts):

{
  "id": "string",
  "question": "string",
  "description": "string (optional)",
  "answers": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "label": "string",
      "next": "string (optional)",
      "autoRefine": true // optional boolean
    }
  ],
  "refinements": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "question": "string",
      "answers": [
        { "id": "string", "label": "string", "next": "string (optional)" }
      ],
      "weights": [
        {
          "id": "string",
          "label": "string",
          "template": "string",
          "min": 1.0,
          "max": 1.3,
          "step": 0.01,
          "default": 1.1
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "weights": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "label": "string",
      "template": "string",
      "min": 1.0,
      "max": 1.3,
      "step": 0.01,
      "default": 1.1
    }
  ]
}


Not all nodes must have refinements or weights, but many should — this is where nuance comes from.

5️⃣ Entry Points: root.json, character + environment roots

You MUST ensure there is a top-level entry node in src/data/interview/root.json:

{
  "id": "root",
  "question": "What are you imagining?",
  "answers": [
    { "id": "character", "label": "A character", "next": "character-identity-root" },
    { "id": "environment", "label": "An environment or scene", "next": "env-root" }
  ]
}


Then:

character-identity-root should live in character/identity.json

env-root should live in environment/env_root.json

Both should fan out into deep trees.

6️⃣ Character System (EXTREME Nuance)

Create a large, interconnected tree for character creation.

6.1 identity.json

Nodes for:

species type: human, elf, dwarf, orc, angel, demon, fae, beastfolk, android, cyborg, alien archetype, etc.

Answer selection should lead into:

scifi-races-root (for alien/robot types)

Include weights where appropriate, e.g., “fantasy intensity”, “non-human traits emphasis”.

🔟 Connectivity and Flow

Make sure:

Every next points to a valid id in some JSON file.

There are no dead ends until a natural “end of interview” point.

You can have multiple end points where next is null; in those, the engine should consider the interview finished.

1️⃣1️⃣ Safety & Tone

All content must remain:

non-sexual, non-explicit

non-fetish

respectful regarding ethnicity, culture, and body

focused on visual / stylistic / atmospheric nuance

Use safe, neutral, creative language.

1️⃣2️⃣ DO NOT

Do not:

Change TypeScript or React source files

Change ABOUT_THE_PROGRAM.txt

Implement randomizers, presets, or editors in this prompt

Add NSFW or explicit attributes

Your job in this prompt is only to generate and fill out JSON files under src/data/interview/ with an EXTREMELY nuanced, deeply layered decision tree as described.

📌 End of Cursor Prompt

Paste this entire thing into Cursor and let it generate the JSON content.

If you want, next I can:

Design specific example nodes for one branch (e.g. full “anime elf mage in enchanted forest” path)

Help you debug the first run once Cursor has generated everything

Or design a smaller “test tree” to validate behavior before plugging in the full dataset.
