🟣 GUIDED PROMPT INTERVIEW CREATOR — FULL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

This document describes the complete architecture, purpose, and behavior of the Guided Prompt Interview Creator, a standalone application designed to build extremely high-quality Stable Diffusion prompts through an adaptive question-and-answer interview system.

============================================================
1. PURPOSE OF THE APPLICATION
============================================================

The Guided Prompt Interview Creator is an interactive system that helps users build complex and nuanced Stable Diffusion prompts without manually constructing text, understanding AI prompt engineering, or navigating complex settings.

Instead of presenting long lists of tags, toggles, and text inputs, the app works like a creative assistant that asks the user structured questions. Each answer leads to the next, eventually producing a rich, highly detailed, weight-enhanced AI image prompt.

This makes the tool ideal for:

Beginners who want guidance

Artists who want structured work

Professionals who want fine-grained control

Users who want high-quality, consistent output

The application focuses exclusively on Guided Interview Mode.
Other features such as randomization, preset builders, tag editing, or library managers are intentionally not included.

============================================================
2. TOP-LEVEL CONCEPT
============================================================

The application behaves like a branching interview system, where each question leads to the next based on the user's answers.

Each question can include:

A main question ("What hair type?")

Answer choices

Optional refinement questions

Optional weight sliders

Optional descriptions

Optional auto-suggest buttons

Each question is part of a decision tree, defined entirely through JSON files.

Whenever the user provides an answer, the system:

Records the answer

Moves to the next appropriate node

Updates the prompt preview

Displays additional refinements or weight controls when necessary

This continues until the interview reaches a natural conclusion.

============================================================
3. USER EXPERIENCE SUMMARY
============================================================
Screen Layout

The app uses a two-column layout:

LEFT:

A large, centered "Question Card" shows the current question

Answer buttons

Refinement questions

Weight sliders

Navigation buttons ("Back" and "Suggest for Me")

A step indicator ("Step 4 of 12")

RIGHT:

A live-updating Prompt Preview

Displays assembled text for the final Stable Diffusion prompt

Updates after every answer or slider change

Flow Example

“What are you imagining?”
→ User selects “A character.”

“What gender is the character?”
→ User selects “Female.”

“What age?”
→ User selects “Young adult.”

“What is the hair like?”
→ User selects “Curly.”

“How curly?” (refinement)
→ User selects “Defined curls.”

Curl Intensity (weight slider)
→ User sets “1.18”

Environment questions

Artistic style questions

Final composition questions

Upon completion, the app assembles the full prompt.

============================================================
4. USER INTERFACE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
============================================================

The UI visually matches the preview concept:

COLOR PALETTE

Background: #0F0F12

Cards: #1A1A1F

Accent color: #6E56F9 (violet glow)

Text: white + soft grays

Borders: subtle transparent whites

COMPONENT STYLE

Rounded corners (18–20px)

Soft drop shadows

Violet outer glow

Clean geometric typography (Inter or Manrope)

Smooth transitions

BUTTONS

Soft pill shape

Hover glow

Subtle press animation

SLIDERS

Dark track with violet fill

Glowing thumb control

Numeric value displayed on the right

ANIMATION

Fade transitions when moving between questions

Smooth updates to preview panel

This creates a calm, cinematic, modern design meant to immerse the user.

============================================================
5. DECISION TREE SYSTEM
============================================================

All flow logic is defined in JSON files stored in:

src/data/interview/


Each file defines one or more nodes in the decision tree.

Nodes contain:

id

question

description (optional)

answers (required)

refinements (optional)

weights (optional)

File loading

The application automatically loads all .json files in that folder using:

import.meta.glob('/src/data/interview/*.json', { eager: true })


This means:

Adding new interview categories is as simple as creating new JSON files

No code changes are required

============================================================
6. INTERVIEW ENGINE
============================================================

The core logic is implemented in a React hook:

useInterviewEngine()


Responsibilities:

6.1 Track State

Current question node

History of visited nodes

Selected answers

Selected refinements

Slider values for weighted attributes

6.2 Navigation

next(answerId) moves to the next node

previous() goes back to the prior node

reset() restarts the interview

6.3 Real-Time Preview

getPreviewPrompt() returns the partial or final prompt text, dynamically assembled.

6.4 Completion

isFinished() identifies when no further nodes remain.

The engine creates a structured pipeline from the user’s responses to the final prompt.

============================================================
7. WEIGHT SYSTEM (ADVANCED NUANCE)
============================================================

Any node or refinement node may include weight sliders.

Weights adjust how strongly something is represented in the final prompt:

Example:

"weights": [
  {
    "id": "curl_intensity",
    "label": "Curl Intensity",
    "template": "curl intensity",
    "min": 1.0,
    "max": 1.3,
    "step": 0.01,
    "default": 1.12
  }
]


This creates a slider.

The final prompt will then include:

(curl intensity:1.12)


Weights allow for:

nuance

subtlety

intensity control

stylization

depth

This system is essential for high-quality prompt engineering.

============================================================
8. PROMPT ASSEMBLY
============================================================

A dedicated file:

src/services/promptAssembler.ts


Collects:

The main subject

All selected attributes

All refinement answers

All weights

Then it outputs a professionally structured Stable Diffusion prompt.

Example output:

A young adult female character with defined curly hair (curl intensity:1.18),
standing in an enchanted forest (magical atmosphere:1.32),
anime style, soft ambient lighting, subtle particle effects.

Negative prompt:
deformed, distorted, extra limbs, low detail, low quality, bad anatomy


The preview panel updates continuously as the user builds their character or environment.

============================================================
9. WHAT THIS APP IS NOT
============================================================

This program intentionally does not include:

❌ Random prompt generator
❌ Traditional prompt builder interface
❌ Tag library manager
❌ JSON editor
❌ Preset system
❌ Multi-mode navigation

The entire project is ONLY the Guided Prompt Interview Creator.

============================================================
10. CORE PRINCIPLES AND DESIGN VALUES
============================================================
✔ Simplicity

Users should never feel overwhelmed. Questions appear one at a time with gentle pacing.

✔ Nuance

Every answer can be refined. Every detail can be weighted. Prompts become extremely rich.

✔ Expandability

Adding new topics (e.g., “makeup style”, “weather”, “camera angle”) only requires creating new JSON files.

✔ User agency

Users can:

choose answers

refine them

adjust weights

or press “Suggest for me”

✔ Transparency

The prompt preview always shows what is being created.

✔ Clarity

Explanations and labels are layman-friendly.

============================================================
11. INTENDED FUTURE EXPANSIONS
============================================================

Although not part of this version, the system is designed to support:

Multiple interview modes

Preset questionnaires

Character save/load

Library editing UI

Prompt randomization overlays

Style modules (anime, realism, watercolor, cyberpunk)

The architecture allows infinite growth.

============================================================
12. SUMMARY
============================================================

The Guided Prompt Interview Creator is a deeply nuanced, adaptive, user-friendly system for generating high-quality Stable Diffusion prompts. It functions through a JSON-powered decision tree, a dynamic interview engine, and a clean, cinematic UI modeled after a modern creative assistant.
